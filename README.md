## Hey there! I'm Arjun 👋  
Breaking things to learn how they work. Fixing them so they work better.  
A full-stack web developer with a love for clean code, powerful UIs, and real-world impact. I’m working on a lot of things and I’m just getting started.

### 🚀 What I’m Up To

🔭 Currently building full-stack applications using the **MERN stack**  
🌱 Diving deeper into backend architecture, clean APIs, and DevOps  
🛠 Focused on performance optimization, user experience, and modern frontend design  
👀 Exploring tools like Redux Toolkit and custom hooks to build scalable apps  
🌌 Experimenting with **Three.js** to bring interactive 3D elements to the web — expect more on that here soon!  
🧠 Trying to make the user experience seamless without overcomplicating the codebase
